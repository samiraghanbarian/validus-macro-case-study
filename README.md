# Validus Macro Strategy Case Study - Quantitative Research

## Overview


This repository contains my solutions to the case study provided by the Validus Macro Strategy team. The case study involves implementing different options trading strategies on the S&P500 index, calculating daily **Mark-to-Market (MTM)** values, **delta** values, and **implied volatility** values for each strategy.
